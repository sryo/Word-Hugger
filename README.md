Word Hugger scans all the text elements on the current Figma page, identifying and adjusting paragraphs that end with short, isolated words â€“ commonly referred to as "orphans." By converting the space before these orphans into a non-breaking space, the code ensures that these words are not isolated at the end of a paragraph.

In typography, an orphan is a single word at the end of a paragraph. Orphans can disrupt the visual rhythm and balance of a page, making the layout appear uneven and possibly hindering readability. Adjusting them ensures a more aesthetically pleasing and cohesive presentation of text, offering readers a smoother experience.
